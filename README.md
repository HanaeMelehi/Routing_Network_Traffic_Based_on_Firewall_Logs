Project Overview:

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a dataset comprising 12 features, focusing primarily on the "Action" variable, which is divided into four distinct classes. The attributes include information such as source and destination ports, bytes, packets, elapsed time, etc.

Several models are defined, including Naive Bayes, Dummy Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier with isotonic calibration, Gradient Boosting Classifier with isotonic calibration, AdaBoost Classifier with isotonic calibration, XGBoost Classifier with isotonic calibration, and Voting Classifier with isotonic calibration. Each model is presented along with its definition and usage notes.

The project evaluates the performance of each model, comparing classifier performances to provide a comprehensive understanding of each model's prediction quality. Results are analyzed in terms of log loss, confusion matrix, precision, and recall.

Keywords: Dataset, Action Classes, Classification Models, Performance Evaluation.
